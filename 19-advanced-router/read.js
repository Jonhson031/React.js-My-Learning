// In this section, you learned about the json() utility method and the defer() method.

// Both methods are no longer supported / needed when using React Router v7 (check your package.json file).

// ! Instead of using json(), you should construct a Response manually, as shown in this section:

throw new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Could not fetch events.' }), {
    status: 500,
});
// Instead of using defer(), you can directly return an object that contains unresolved promises.

// ! I.e., instead of writing this code:

// export async function loader() {
//   return defer({
//     events: loadEvents(),
//   });
// }

// * Use this code with React Router v7:

// export async function loader() {
//   return {
//     events: loadEvents(),
//   };
// }
// Also make sure to remove the defer import at the top of the file.

// That's all! No further changes are needed, you still use the <Await> component as shown in this section. And all the other code also stays & works the way you learned it.
